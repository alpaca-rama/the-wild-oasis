# My Review
This is Jonas's React course I took after taking his brilliant [Javascript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
This course goes into deep details and is not just a code along. Jonas gives in depth reasoning and details about each section.
The course will be slower than most to the slow pacing of his speech but he comes out clear and concise which helps with the learning process.
I would recommend this course
